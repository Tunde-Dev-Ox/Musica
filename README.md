# Musica
Musica is a music streaming webapp built with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
With Musica, you can create an account, login, listen to any music of your choice and also create playlists.
It's still a work in progress.
The final idea of Musical is to be able to play any music of your choice and to also have a payment feature.
